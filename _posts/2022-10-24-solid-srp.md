> **Single Responsible Principle (SRP)** suggest to include everything in a class or module should only be related to a single responsibility or task. Can have multiple properties and methods as long they are related to a single functionality or responsibility.

## Example: Without Single Responsibility Principle

- Below snippet shows a `User` class that consist multiple responsibilities, this is not a good practice for a bigger and complex application, as this will make the code become much **harder to understand, to test and harder to maintain**.

```c#
namespace SOLID_SRP
{
 public class User
 {
  public void CreateUser()
  {
   // ...
  }

  public void UpdateUser()
  {
   // ...
  }

  public void GenerateReceipt()
  {
   // ...
  }

  public void ConvertReciptToPDF()
  {
   // ...
  }
 }
}
```

- `User` 's class responsibility is to handle anything that are related with the `User`. But snippet above shows that there are two method that holds different responsibilities, in this case it's `GenerateScript()` and `ConvertReceiptToPDF()`.

## Example: With Single Responsibility Principle

- Below snippets show two different classes that has its own responsibility.

```c#
namespace SOLID_SRP
{
 public class User
 {
  public void CreateUser()
  {
   // ...
  }

  public void UpdateUser()
  {
   // ...
  }
 }
}
```

- `User`'s class shows that it only hold methods and properties that are related with its responsibility, this will reduce code complexity and increase maintainability.

```c#
namespace SOLID_SRP
{
 public class Receipt
 {
  public void GenerateReceipt()
  {
   // ...
  }

  public void ConvertReciptToPDF()
  {
   // ...
  }
 }
}
```

- `Receipt`'s class hold methods that are responsible in handling the receipt process which are not related to `User`'s  class whatsoever.

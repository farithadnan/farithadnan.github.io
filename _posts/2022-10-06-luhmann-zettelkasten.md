**Luhmann's Zettelkasten** is  a note taking system that has been created by Niklas Luhmann who is a social scientist that has published over 50 books and 600 articles.

This system uses a collection of notes that has *hypertext* or I would like to call it *hyperlink*  which enable user to navigate across different notes easily without spending too much time to find it.  The way this system is able to distinguish between notes is by adding *reference* (hypertext) that uses numbering or alphabetic characters on every notes.  

By using Zettelkasten, connecting or referencing other note is possible and make the note taking experiences better. Connecting between notes will help your brain to be a better observer and expand your knowledge.

Below shows a numbering system for Luhman's Zettelkasten:

Luhmann wanted his Zettelkasten to have be able to go from one note to another, in a much faster way, thus, he created this reference point in a note with number and alphabet.

Focus on the note number 1 and 2 as shown in the picture above, these two has different number to represent the different between them. But in case you want to add new additional note for the note number 1, you can assign the new note with **1a** and **1b** for the next new note in sequence. Plus, if you want to add a new additional note for the note number **1a**, you can assign the new note with **1a1** and **1a2** for the next new note in sequence.

As you see can there's an alternation occur within the sequence of the note labelling between number and alphabet. If let say the parent note's label end with number, its new child note will then end its label with alphabet instead, this alternation continues as long as there is a new note branching off from another.  

## Side Note

> I first learnt about Luhmann's Zettelkasten from this [Obsidian's forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/one-vault-vs-multiple-vaults/1445) when trying to built My First Obsidian Setup.

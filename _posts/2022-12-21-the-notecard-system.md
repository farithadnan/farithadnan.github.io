## Background

The notecard system, also known as the Cornell Method, is a system for organizing and studying notes that was developed by Francis A. Cornell in the 1950s. It is based on the idea of breaking down notes into smaller chunks of information and organizing them on index cards, with each card containing a single key concept or idea.

The notecard system has a long history, with roots dating back to the 19th century. It was popularized in the 1950s by Cornell, who developed it as a method for organizing and studying notes for exams. The system has since been used by students and educators around the world as a way to organize and review notes.

## Relation with Zettelkasten

The notecard system is related to the Zettelkasten, a system for organizing notes and ideas developed by the German sociologist and philosopher Niklas Luhmann. Like the notecard system, the Zettelkasten involves organizing notes on index cards or slips of paper and linking them together through a system of references and associations.

## Do people still use it

Although the notecard system is not as widely used as it once was, there are still many people who find it to be an effective way to organize and review notes. Some students and educators continue to use the notecard system as a tool for studying and reviewing information, and it can also be a useful tool for organizing ideas and thoughts in a more structured way.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the notecard system is a method for organizing and studying notes that has a long history and is related to the Zettelkasten. Although it is not as widely used as it once was, there are still many people who find it to be an effective tool for organizing and reviewing information.

>A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.

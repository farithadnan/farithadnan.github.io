## What is Scrum

> **Scrum** is an [[Agile Methodology |Agile]] project management framework that help teams to develop, deliver and maintain complex products/projects.

- Scrum and [[Agile Methodology |Agile]] can't be use interchangeably. Because **[[Agile Methodology |Agile]] is a set of principles** while **Scrum is the framework that uses [[Agile Methodology |Agile]] to get the work done.**
- With Scrum, it encourage the teams to think in an [[Agile Methodology |Agile]]'s way and implement [[Agile Methodology |Agile]]'s principle within the interaction and their works.
- Can be implement for any field and not just for software development/engineering field only.

## Why Scrum

- Software always changes (Goals, requirement and etc.) and scrum **embrace those changes** which will help teams to deliver  client's requirement much effectively.
- With scrum, project is built in a series of iteration called [[Scrum Framework#What is Sprints |Sprints]] which will have a set of thing to do when developing the application, thus makes handling the project much easier and able to deliver high quality output faster with flexibility to adapt changes.
- Scrum transparency and its iterative nature helps reduce risk, cost, hasten the development and get a fast feedback from the end user.
- Every sprint has their own goals/milestone, and this will give teams tangible target and will keep them more focus and motivated.

## Key Roles in Scrum

There is **three key roles for the scrum roles**, and this roles is necessary for scrum. The roles include **Product Owner, Scrum Master and Team.** Below shows a brief explanation about each of these role.

### 1. Product Owner

- Person that responsible defining the features of the project.
- Client/end-user

### 2. Scrum Master

- Mediary between user and team
- Managing the team and the process
- Keeping things in check and the project going

### 3. Team

- Developer, designer and etc.
- Building the product.

## Work Items

- User Stories (features); non technical description on what user want  and this is from user's perspective. Example:
  - *"As a {type of user}, I want {goal} so that I {receive benefit} "*
  - *"As a customer, I want to be able to create an account so that I can see my previous purchases."*
- Tasks
- Bugs/Issues

## Key Artifacts/Documents in Scrum

Key Artifacts can **also be known as document** in Scrum.

### 1. Product Backlog

- List of prioritize user stories created by the product owner that could be implement into the end product.
- List evolve and changes priority in every sprint.
- **User stories** is a descriptive description about the features set so that product owner can specify the details to the team so that they're able to estimate the effort required to complete the work of the story.

### 2. Sprint Backlog

- The highest priority of user stories/work items will go to the sprint backlog which have been committed for the next sprint.
- Its like a checker for the user stories/work items, if its ready then it will send to the next sprints.
- Product owner and team have high understanding about each of the user stories/work items involved, based on the discussion in Sprint planning meeting.

### 3. Burndown Chart

- A Burndown Chart shows the actual and estimated amount of work to be done in a sprint.
- Show progress during a sprint on the completion of task in the sprint backlog.
- This chart will approach zero point as the work is being completed.

## Ceremonies in Scrum

Can think of it as a **meeting or discussion between team members.**

### 1. Sprint Planning

- Product owner, scrum master and team **discussing about the top priority user stories/work items and which user stories will be put into the next sprint.**
- The output of this ceremony is Sprint backlog.

### 2. Daily Scrum

- Discuss about the work they have done, what they will be working on today and anything that need helps from other, this is to smoothen the development process.  

### 3. Sprint Review and Retrospective

- Happen at the end of the sprint.
- **Sprint Review:** Teams demonstrate complete product to the product owner
- **Retrospective:** Discuss what process they can improve going forward.

## What is Sprints

> **Sprints** is a time-boxed period for the scrum teams to works a set amount of work. Teams forecast to complete a set of user stories or other work items during a fixed time duration

- Sprints make project become more manageable. Allow to deliver high quality output faster and give more flexible to adapt to change.
- Sprint contains a set of committed user stories/work items from the sprint backlog that will be work within the sprint until the completion.
- Daily scrum will also be done within the sprint phase, this is to ensure the development progress runs smoothly.
- Every sprint will have its own sprint goal which is defined by the product owner. Sprint considered success if the sprint goal is achieved.
- Sprint period usually takes about 1-3 weeks each.
- Sprints can also be called - incremental releases

if the sprint has incomplete issues, Issues in this context represent work items. you can:

- Move the issue to the backlog
- Move the issue to a future sprint

Below shows a simplify representation of a sprint and a brief explanation about it:

- **Each set of user stories/work items consist their own cycle workflow (planning, building, testing and reviewing)**, after this cycle is completed we will have a potential shippable product. For the next section will explain more details about the Sprint's cycle workflow.

## Scrum Workflow (Inside Sprint)

Below shows a simplify representation of the workflow and a brief explanations about it:

![Image of Sprint](/posts/20221103/scrum-workflow.png)

### Product Backlog

- Contains prioritized user stories/work items list created by the product owner which could potentially be added into the product.
- Product backlog will be use in the sprint planning phase to determine the details and the size of the task to the team.

### Sprint Planning

- Sprint planning is where the product owner. scrum master and the team discuss about the top priorities user stories/work items to determine what user stories/work items will go into the next sprint.
- After determine what the user stories/work items should be put into the next sprint, this phase will generate sprint  backlog as its output.

### Sprint Backlog

- Contains the list of user stories/work items that been committed for the next sprint. In this phase product owner and the team already understand what user stories/work items that will be put into the product.

### Sprint

- **Sprints** is a 1- 3 weeks time-boxed where the committed user stories/work items from the backlog is work on until the completion.
- During sprint phase, daily scrum meeting occur to make sure the development progress is in the right track.
- This is were the building and testing on the user stories/work items happen.
- The development team will work on the sprint until the sprint goal is achieved.

### Potentially Shippable Product

- Output from the completion of  a sprint.
- Product owner determine whether the product is ready to be ship or any additional user stories/work items/pieces/features to be added.

### Sprint Review & Retrospective

- At the end of the sprint, Sprint Review and Retrospective meetings occur.
- **Sprint Review:** Teams demonstrate completed product to the product owner
- **Retrospective:** Discuss what process they can improve going forward.

This workflow will be repeated for each sprint.

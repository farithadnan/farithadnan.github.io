> **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** suggests that the class shouldn't be force to implement all of the methods that have been defined by the large interface, instead of grouping a big number of method into one interface, numerous interface is preferred.
>
> Like **[Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](/posts/solid-srp/)** where it separated the classes and its properties into single responsibility, same concept can be apply for **interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** instead of using classes, we use interface instead.

## Example: Without Interface Segregation Principle

- Below shows a snippet, as you can see there's an interface `IUserDetails` that hold three method that can be use by other classes and also there's `BasicUserDetail` and `UserSalary` that uses `IUserDetails`'s methods to execute their task.
- In `BasicUserDetail` all method from the `IUserDetails` were being implemented while in `UserSalary` `Address` and `Contact` are not required for the class but were still being implemented by the class because if not, it will return an error, and this behavior is against the ISP rule.
- To counter this, violation against the ISP, splitting the `IUserDetails` into different interfaces is required this is to prevent unwanted behavior that happen inside `UserSalary`.  See next snippet for solution.

```c#
public interface IUserDetails
{
 void Address(string name);
 void Contact(string name);
 void Salary(string name);
}

public class BasicUserDetail : IUserDetails
{
 public void Address(string name)
 {
  Console.WriteLine("John Doe");
 }
 
 public void Contact(string name)
 {
  Console.WriteLine("0123456789");
 }

 public void Salary(string name)
 {
  Console.WriteLine("666666666");
 }

}

public class UserSalary: IUserDetails
{
 public void Address(string name)
 {
  throw new NotImplementedException();
 }
 
 public void Contact(string name)
 {
  throw new NotImplementedException();
 }

 public void Salary(string name)
 {
  Console.WriteLine("666666666");
 }
}
```

## Example: With Interface Segregation Principle

- Below is a snippet that shows how ISP is being implemented, the snippet is based on previous section. As you can see the `IUserDetails`'s interface has been separated into three; `IUserAddress`, `IUserContact` and `IUserSalary`.
- `BasicUserDetail`'s can implement all of it necessary methods by using all of these three interfaces.  While `UserSalary`'s class only need to use `IUserSalary`'s  interface to fetch its necessary method. With this each class can implement method that are required to them only.

```c#
public interface IUserAddress
{
 void Address(string name);
}

public interface IUserContact
{
 void Contact(string name);
}

public interface IUserSalary
{
 void Salary(string name);
}

public class BasicUserDetail : IUserAddress, IUserContact, IUserSalary
{
 public void Address(string name)
 {
  Console.WriteLine("John Doe");
 }
 
 public void Contact(string name)
 {
  Console.WriteLine("0123456789");
 }

 public void Salary(string name)
 {
  Console.WriteLine("666666666");
 }

}

public class UserSalary: IUserSalary
{
 public void Salary(string name)
 {
  Console.WriteLine("666666666");
 }
}
```

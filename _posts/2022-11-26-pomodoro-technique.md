> Time management method created by [Francesco Cirillo](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/francesco-cirillo) in the late 1980s who is at the time was an university student. He created this method because he's struggling  to focus on his studies and complete assignment. **Pomodoro** means tomato in italian.

How does it work:

1. Create a to-do list and pick one task
2. Set 25 minutes timer
3. Work on the task you have chosen exclusively without any interruption, stopping to work on anything else or taking a break until the time is up
4. When 25 minutes is up, stop working and take a 5 minutes break. You have now complete one pomodoro.
5. Set a timer for another 25 minutes and continue working on the task until finished. Pick another task when done.
6. Every 4 Pomodoro, take a longer 15-30 minutes break.
7. Repeat as needed.

## Pomodoro can also be flexible

Depends on the task you're doing sometimes 25 minutes is not enough, you can change the pomodoro session to 30 - 50 minutes with 15 - 20 minutes break and 1 hour break after 4 pomodoro. But you change the time based on your own requirement, pomodoro is flexible method so keep that in mind!

## Prevent Planning Fallacy/Cognitive Bias with Pomodoro

> When planning out our future projects, most of us fall victim to the [planning fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy) — our tendency to vastly underestimate the time needed to complete future tasks, even when we know similar tasks have taken longer in the past.Your present self imagines [your future self](https://blog.doist.com/present-self-vs-future-self/?itm_campaign=pomodoro&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides) operating under entirely different circumstances and time restraints. - Todoist

Other scientists, in “[An Economic Model](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/planning_fallacy_0.pdf) of The Planning Fallacy” (2008), say:

> _“_**_Faced with an unpleasant task_**_, people tend both to underestimate the time necessary to complete the task and to postpone working on the task. Thus projects often take inordinately long to complete and people struggle to meet, or even miss, deadlines”._

- With Pomodoro we can prevent planning fallacy from happening, where it encourages us to dissect down the big task into actionable and plausible task,
- When dissecting the big task into smaller part, we can estimate the time to finish much more clearly and less daunting.
- By focusing one task at the time using pomodoro technique  which also comes with a break session in between each session, it can helps us becoming much more focus, less stressful and procrastinate-proof.

## Pomodoro Rules

1. **Breakdown complex projects** - if the task require more than four pomodoros, then task needs to be divided into smaller parts and actionable task.
2. **Small tasks go together** - Any other small task that take less than one pomodoro need to be combine into one session. For example, "write rent check," "set vet appointment," and "read Pomodoro article" could go together in one session.
3. **Once pomodoro is set, it must ring** - pomodoro must be executed till completion. Ignore all interruptions no checking messages and etc.

> - In case of any unavoidable interruption, take your 5 minutes break and start again. Any interruption need to be track/jot down as they occur and reflect on how to avoid them in the next session.
> - In case you complete your task before time limits, use that extra time to learn new things and improve skills.

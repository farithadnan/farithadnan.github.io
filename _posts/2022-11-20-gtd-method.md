## How GTD works

There's five steps in GTD which is Capture, Clarify, Organize, Review and Engage. Below shows a brief explanation about each steps.

### Step 1: Capture

- Any tasks, events or ideas that you have in your mind you need to immediately store it in your "Inbox". Even if the tasks, events or idea doesn't have any exact completion date or complete requirements.
- Inbox is like the representation of urgency that will motivate you to take care of it regularly.
- Keeping your inbox is always the goals for this step.

### Step 2: Clarify

- Defining cluttered information inside inbox by converting them into an actionable step that has date, due date, description and etc.
- with Todoist you can move all the actionable step or processed info into project section, where you can create your own type of project/category like personal, work, business and etc. You can choose which processed info will go to a which project, this will ensure clarity for the user.

### Step 3: Organize

- Add another level of clarification to the task, by bind it to the calendar app for reminder, delegate task to team member and etc.
- Bind your processed task into a calendar app.
- Delegate the task to your team member
- In Todoist, inside the project section, you can create your own custom sections/contexts where you can define/organize the task within the project and determine which task is important or not. Example: Todays task, next week task, next month task and etc.

### Step 4: Engage

- This section tells how to properly implementing the task by identifying the priority level of each task.
- By knowing the level priority you can determine when the task should be done based on its priority level.
- By using Todoist you can execute this step way easier!

### Step 5: Review

- Review enable refinement of "when the task should be done"
- Improve task scheduling and time management for each task.
